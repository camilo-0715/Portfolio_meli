# Portfolio

## Introduction
I am a dedicated Robotics Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Robotics Software Engineering and a year of professional experience at Bertrand Technologies Spain and Airbus DS. My expertise centers around developing and optimizing software for robotic systems, focusing on enhancing functionality and efficiency. At Bertrand Technologies, I have contributed to innovative projects, developing software for advanced robotics applications. My experience at Airbus DS has further honed my skills in aerospace robotics, where precision and reliability are paramount. Proficient in programming languages like Python and C++, and familiar with ROS (Robot Operating System), I am passionate about applying my knowledge to solve complex challenges in robotics and artificial intelligence.

## Projects

### Autonomous driving in CARLA based on reinforcement learning
One of my most notable achievements was the distinction of an honors mention for my final grade project at my university, which was awarded a perfect score of 10. In this project, I engineered an autonomous driving solution for a vehicle in the CARLA simulator, harnessing neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques, which endowed the vehicle with the capabilities to avoid obstacles and adjust to traffic flow dynamically. The comprehensive endeavor involved not only the creation of the autonomous system but also the development of a detailed thesis that articulated the project's intricacies and a formal presentation to the university's examining commitee

### NFC implant

another of my most important projects was the development of software for a chimp NFC implant in my left hand, a personal biohacking initiative. The applications I developed include transitioning slides during presentations, unlocking mechanisms, and controlling music on platforms like Spotify. This implant not only demonstrates my proficiency and passion for cutting-edge technology but also represents my forward-thinking vision. I am eager to expand the chip's functionality by creating more sophisticated applications in the near future. Furthermore, I am considering the integration of additional implants to achieve multifaceted functionalities, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of biorobotics.

### Genetic algorithm trained Mario bros agent

I have developed a genetic algorithm agent that is capable of solving levels in the popular game Mario Bros. This project represents a unique intersection of artificial intelligence and gaming, where the agent uses principles of genetic algorithms to navigate and complete various levels of the game. This approach not only demonstrates the agent's problem-solving capabilities but also showcases the potential of genetic algorithms in complex decision-making scenarios.

The entire development process of this project, including the code, has been meticulously documented and is available for review. For those interested in the technical details, the strategies employed by the agent, and the evolutionary aspects of the algorithm, you can find all this information in the link provided below. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource, offering insights into the intricacies of applying genetic algorithms to video game environments, particularly in a game as dynamic and challenging as Mario Bros.

### Automatic mecanism for wheelchair

I am presently engaged in a compelling project that seeks to revolutionize mobility for individuals with physical limitations. This venture, a collaboration with a skilled colleague, involves customizing a wheelchair for a client who experiences reduced mobility. Our goal is to develop an automated mechanism for rotating the wheelchair seat, a feature aimed at enhancing user autonomy and comfort. This project is not just a testament to our technical expertise, but also reflects our dedication to improving lives through innovative solutions.

As the project is in its developmental phase, itâ€™s a journey of continual learning and adaptation. We are meticulously documenting our progress, from conceptual designs to the intricate details of mechanical engineering. This documentation will be regularly updated on this [dedicated GitHub repository](https://github.com/camilo-0715/Mecanismo-para-el-giro-automatico-de-un-scooter-para-personas-con-movilidad-reducida), allowing interested parties to track our progress and engage with the project. This repository will soon be made accessible, offering insights into our creative process and the challenges we navigate to bring this transformative idea to fruition.
